Extra virgin olive oil
6 slices Bacon, cut crosswise into  1/2 inch strips
3 Tbsp. Unsalted butter
1 Onion, cut into  1/4 inch dice
Kosher salt
 1/2 cup All-purpose flour
4 cups whole milk, plus more as needed
1 pound (454 g) Shells or other short pasta
1  1/2 cups Freshly grated Cheddar cheese
1  1/2 cups Freshly grated Fontina cheese
 1/2 cup Freshly grated Parmigiano cheese
 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
Hot sauce, to taste
","Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a large saucepan, add the bacon, and bring the pan to medium heat. Stir the bacon occasionally. When it’s crispy, remove it from the pan and drain on paper towels. Do not discard the bacon fat!

Add the butter and onion to the pan with the fat, season with salt, and cook until the onion is soft and aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, season with salt, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Cook over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes.



Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the instructions on the package suggest. Drain the pasta and reserve.

Add the cheddar, fontina, Parmigiano and pulverized Cheetos<sup>®</sup> Puffs White Cheddar to the milk mixture and whisk to combine. Add the mustard and a few shakes of hot sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding a little more milk if the mixture seems too thick. Stir in the cooked bacon and pasta.

Sprinkle with Cheetos Crunchy<sup>®</sup> Flamin’ Hot<sup>®</sup> and put under the broiler until it gets crispy and crunchy.

So this is my gift to you—my top (not-so) secret recipe for Flamin’ Hot<sup>®</sup> Tamales. Don’t say I never gave you anything.","For the tamales:
1 c. Cheetos Crunchy<sup>®</sup> Flamin’ Hot<sup>®</sup>  snacks, finely ground (reserve a little extra for garnish)
1 1/2 c. yellow masa harina corn flour
 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
 1/4 c. butter, melted
1 3/4 c. boiling-hot chicken or vegetable stock
1 tbsp. lime juice
1 tsp. lime zest
10 large dried corn husks, soaked in water for one hour
1 lb. grated pepper jack cheese
Sliced avocado (for presentation)

For the lima cream:
1 c. store-bought crema Mexicana (or fresh sour cream)
Juice and zest of 1 lime
 1/2 tsp. salt

For the lime-pickled onions:
1 red onion, fine julienne
Juice of 1 lime
 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
1 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
","In a large bowl, use a mixer to combine the Cheetle™ (ground Cheetos<sup>®</sup>), masa harina, salt, baking powder and cayenne until well combined.
On medium speed, add the butter, hot stock, lime juice and zest. Turn speed to high for about 2 minutes until the masa is light and fluffy.
Lay out the corn husks and divide the masa between them.
Using a rubber spatula, spread the masa out into a 5-inch square stretching from the broad edge of the corn husk to three-quarters of the way to the top and centered from side to side. Make sure the thickness is even.
Place a little more than  1/2 c. of grated cheese in your hand and squeeze it into a 4-inch-long tube. Place it in the center, and then roll one edge over the top. Gently pull the corn husk away, and roll the other side over so that they overlap masa on masa. Roll the corn husk up, and then using a thin strip of corn husk, tie the top of the tamale off about 2 inches from the top. Repeat for each tamale.
Put a steamer basket inside a pot filled with  3/4 inch of water (water line should be just below the basket). Gently place tamales in a steamer basket and steam for 20 minutes. 
Turn off the heat and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with lime crema, lime-pickled onions, slices of fresh avocado and a sprinkling of Cheetle™.
